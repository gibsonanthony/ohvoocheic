I think it would have been stronger with a different female lead than Camilla Belle and removal of the romantic plot line, but the rest of the casting was fantastic. I mean Dakota Fanning as a punkish drunk brat, Chris Evans doing his super hero thing before being Cap, and Djimon Hounsou being a bad ass head of a shady organization- it was all a great set up.

If my memory serves me, I believe the movie was recieved poorly and was quickly shoed away from the lime light. My question is why? I watched the movie and enjoyed it end to end. It has a good cast, interesting story, I thought the action was easy to follow and always had geomotry. Was I watching a different movie then the people of 2009?

In no particular order some of my favorite films are: Chinatown, Push (2009), The Grand Budapest Hotel, Inglorious Basterds, In Bruges, Hallam Foe, The Lobster, Trainspotting, Bladerunner 2049, Children of Men, 28 Days Later, and Sleepy Hollow (1999). Ive seen most if not all of Wes Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Martin McDonagh, Danny Boyle, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, and Paul McGuigans work. As you can probably tell I love a good black comic tragedy.
